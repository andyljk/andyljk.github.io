I am Jiakun Li, a first year Ph.D student in the Biostatistics program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My research interest includes multiview data analysis, machine learning, and its applications in neurodegenerative diseases. I am currently working on identifying sensitive, clinical trial-ready biomarkers for Friedrich's Ataxia using bioimaging data of the brain and spinal cord. You can learn more about this project [here](https://www.curefa.org/clinical-trials-active-enrolling/track-fa-study-bioimaging-of-brain-and-spinal-cord).

I finished my undergraduate studies at William & Mary, where I worked on a project investigating the population dynamics of the Chesapeake Blue Crab under the supervision of Dr. Junping Shi and Dr. Romuald Lipcius. I also worked on a computational neuroscience project with Dr. Mainak Patel and Dr. Ross Iaci, where we analyzed neuron activity data to identify patterns of response motifs in the Honey Bee antennal lobe.
