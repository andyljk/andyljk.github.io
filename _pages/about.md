I am Jiakun Li, a first year Ph.D student in the Biostatistics program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My research interest includes multiview data analysis, machine learning, and its applications in neurodegenerative diseases. I am currently working on identifying sensitive, clinical trial-ready biomarkers for Freidrich's Ataxia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using MRI imaging data.

I finished my undergraduate studies at William & Mary, where I worked on a project investigating the population dynamics of the Chesapeake Blue Crab under the supervision of Dr. Junping Shi and Dr. Romuald Lipcius. I also worked on a computational neuroscience project with Dr. Mainak Patel and Dr. Ross Iaci, where we analyzed neuron activity data to identify patterns of response motifs in the Honey Bee antennal lobe.
