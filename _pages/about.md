I am Jiakun Li, a third year Ph.D. student in the Biostatistics program at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities (expected graduation: May 2027). My research interests is at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and optimization. Specifically, I work on the following areas:
1. Dimension reduction and imputation methods for longitudinal data, and their applications in omics data and neurodegenerative diseases.
2. Bayesian transfer learning and their generalization capabilities.
3. Computationally efficient algorithms for Bayesian high dimensional models.

I am also a member of TRACK-FA: a global consortium identifying sensitive, clinical trial-ready biomarkers for Friedreich's Ataxia using bioimaging data of the brain and spinal cord. You can learn more about this project [here](https://www.curefa.org/clinical-trials-active-enrolling/track-fa-study-bioimaging-of-brain-and-spinal-cord).

I completed my undergraduate studies at William & Mary, where I worked on projects involving population dynamics of the Chesapeake Blue Crab with Dr. Junping Shi and computational neuroscience analysis of honey bee antennal lobe responses with Dr. Mainak Patel and Dr. Ross Iaci.
